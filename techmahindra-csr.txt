6 Reason for not spending entire CSR amount The CSR budget remained unspent partly due to non-availability of
suitable CSR projects during the year and most of the monies spent
represent the payments made for the long term projects approved
during FY 2017-18. The unspent amount is being carried forward for
funding suitable CSR projects in future.
The CSR committee hereby certifies that the implementation and monitoring of the CSR Policy is in compliance with the CSR objectives and Policy of the Company.
