Your Bank has accelerated its commitments and 
actions in line with India™s sustainable development 

growth trajectory, to create maximum positive social 

and environmental impact. The Bank™s strategic focus 

on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has 

percolated in its core strategy, addressing the need 

of communities through unique CSR programs. In
 
FY 2016-17, your Bank scaled up its initiative of 

providing access to safe and clean drinking water, 

in partnership with the Indian Railways by touching 

more than 1 lakh lives every day across 192 railway 

stations. Since the start of the project in FY 2015-

16, this initiative has provided access to safe and 

clean drinking water, to nearly 5 crore lives. Through 

intensive interventions, your Bank addressed the 

needs of the critical MSME sector. 2,229 MSMEs were 

educated on energy efficiency and occupational health 

and safety of their workers, thereby helping feed into 

India™s larger goals of creating a low carbon economy. 

The Bank™s unique flagship community engagement 

initiative, delivered exponential impact by working on 

socio-environmental issues of national importance like 

financial literacy, Swachh Bharat, road safety, energy 

conservation and creation of a carbon sink through 

tree plantation, touching 20 lakh lives through the year.
As a public trust institution, your Bank exercises 
prudence in undertaking and investing in projects that 

are unique, scalable and sustainable. Implementation 

partners for fulfilling its CSR objectives are selected 

basis strong governance, due-diligence and a 

monitoring framework. Your Bank has adopted 

an approach of effective resource allocation, thus 

generating maximum social value and mindshare. The 

strategy for FY 2016-17 was formulated in order to 

achieve ﬁincreased impact per rupeeﬂ spent on social 

and environmental initiatives. In FY 2016-17, the Bank 

spent 1.39% (
`
 41.66 crores) towards CSR activities; 
an increase of 41% over last year™s spend of 1.24%
 
(
`
 29.52 crores). Since the banking sector is central to 
an economy, your Bank has been mindfully focussing 

on climate action through lending, investing and raising 

capital towards mitigation, adaptation and resilience. 

It continued to serve the larger community through 

livelihood enhancement programs, financial inclusion 
with migrants and large scale projects on sustainable 

energy, which are beyond the ambit of the definition of 

CSR under the Companies Act, 2013.
To meet the daunting task of India™s SDG implementation 
goals, your Bank has committed 
`
 250 crores till
 
FY 2020 towards two key focus areas of livelihood and 

water security, and environment sustainability, through 

focused and intensified CSR and Sustainability actions.
The CSR Committee confirms that the implementation 
and monitoring of CSR Policy, is in compliance with 

CSR objectives and Policy of the Bank.
